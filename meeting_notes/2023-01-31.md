# Questions: 
- what sizes would be useful
- why do we think 1''
- what level of contrast would we need to detect the non-uniformities
- more explanation of how the uplink and central point work
- if looking at Na for telicommunications, i.e. day time use, could it be used for radio, 
	- do we even need it?
	- is there a wavefront?
	- could a similar thing be done in a different band?
- CaNaPy - why different wavefront sensors for LGS and NGS
	- to do with size of target "In practice, as a rule of thumb the Py-WFS is advantageous over the SH-WFS whenever the reference target size is smaller than the diffraction of the SH-WFS subaperture."?
- main benefits of CW vs pulsed laser?
- if summed up all data from the event based sensor would it be the same as a frame based - measure number of photons


# Notes From Papers To Talk About:
- machine learning, for event based sensors looked interesting

# To Do Next: 

sodium layer structure from atmospheric studies
