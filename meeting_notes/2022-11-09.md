#meetingnotes
- R and D development for astronomy and communications (lasers)
- couple longer projects (one more optimechamical engineering, other (more me) study sodium layer
looking at the horizontal extent/ structure of sodium layer)
- look if there is structure to get tip/tilt information
- astronomy mainly looked at vertical, so talk to atmospheric people o=to get more idea about what can
expect, look at different wavefront sensor
- look at using sensors shich look at changes in intensity (event based sensor)
- lots of fundamental research - could get really interesting, or nothing at all
- at start doing simulations !! (modelling atomic stuff, how sodium interacts etc)

- wave front sensor backup if sodium doesn't give good results
- also has money for top up and that ~700K (for networking and conferences)
- don't have to end up putting it on the sky to finish PhD (but could do it in the end)

- look into pros and cons of PhD within instrument development
  - more transferrable
  - more pressure and deadlines
  - rely  a lot on other people, can get stuck
  - SUBARU team fairly stable for at least 2 years, but after that could be stressful, but should
have enough by then to finish up
        - could do exchange w Japan
