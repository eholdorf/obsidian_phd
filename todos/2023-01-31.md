# Summary:

Started reading annual review about adaptive optics in general as a good overview of all of the information. Then had a meeting w Noelia and Monique about admin stuff and went through questions from the papers that I had so far. Talked about the next steps, and will be looking at papers from atmospheric models which look into the horizontal spatial distribution of the Na layer. Also look into event based sensors, Monique sent through a nice overview :), for meeting w man from West-Sydney on Friday or Monday (yet to be confirmed).
