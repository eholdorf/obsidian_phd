notes:
-  Davis station in Antarctica and that instrument was developed by the Australian company ATRAD in collaboration with University of Adelaide

- suggest coupling between the solar activity and mesosphere activity

-  found wave periods in the MLT matched periods of solar activity

- they studied the density of the sodium to find these correlations

- these results have also been observed in Norway, and they found that the trend continued in the extra data that had been taken after
