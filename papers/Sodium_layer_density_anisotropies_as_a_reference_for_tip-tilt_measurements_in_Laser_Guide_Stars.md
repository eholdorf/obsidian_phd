# Notes:
- NGS limit AO capabilities
	- in particular for larger telescopes as the FoV is smaller (thus would need a higher density of NGS c.f. smaller telescopes with larger FoV)
- expect there to be non-uniformities on the 1" scale (~0.4m (40cm))
- need to keep the central part of the LGS illuminated at all times so uplink tip-tilt doesn't change - i.e. only measure the downlink
