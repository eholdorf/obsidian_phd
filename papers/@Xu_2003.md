title: Perturbations of the sodium layer: controlled by chemistry or dynamics?
authors: Jiyao Xu, A. K. Smith
year: 2003

notes:
Â - find that above 85 km that dynamical processes determine strcutures in the sodium layer (e.g. gravity waves and other rapid air motions), but below 85km the structure is determined by chemical prcoesses
