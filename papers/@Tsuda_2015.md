notes:
- looked at velocity of SSL front and compared to background wind (and consistent)

- suggest that SSLs are moved via wind, and not to do with sodium generation

- from looking at 3 different locations, doesn't suggest that there is a sudden growth, as don't see it in all of the beams

- thus must be blown by winds

- 5 beams have distance of 58km betwen them at the sodium layer

- found that there were height differences between the beams which are only consistent with horizontal variations

- below 100km the ion and neutral wind velocities are well coupled

- found velocities of 50 - 70 m/s westward and 20- 50 m/s southward

- remove lower level effects using Rayleigh scattering

- calculated SSL velocity and background, and they are consistent
