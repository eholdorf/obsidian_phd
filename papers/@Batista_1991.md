title: Horizontal structures in sporadic sodium layers at 23°S
authors: Paulo P. Batista, Barclay R. Clemesha, Dale M. Simonich
year: 1991
---
notes:
- measured sodium profiles sequentially at 3 locations in the sky

- found short time structues separated by time lags between the locations

- separation between 3 grouped measurements is 61.4 km, 18.8 km and 37.1 km from zenith (20.9, 6.8 and 14 degrees from zenith)

- found that there were variations between all of the locations

- try to derive a velocity of the wave by assuming anisotropy, but state that gravity waves would probably make this assumption invalid on long timescales

 - noticed that the veritcal variations at all 3 locations seemed to be unique
