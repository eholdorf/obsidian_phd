title: Daytime sodium airglow emission measurements over Trivandrum using a scanning monochromator: first results
authors: M. M. Hossain, T. K. Pant, C. Vineeth, S. G. Sumod, R. Sridharan
year: 2010

notes:
- daytime airglow measurements

- gravity waves significant role in short scale oscillationsÂ 

- airglow from resonance scattering of the neutral Na atoms

- daytime airglow really hard as looking for emission in the bottom of an absorption line
