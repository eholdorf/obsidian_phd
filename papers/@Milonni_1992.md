title: Theory of mesospheric sodium fluorescence excited by pulse trains
authors: P. W. Milonni, L. E. Thode
year: 1992

notes:
- two level model for the mesospheric sodium resonance

- state that Bloch equations needed, rate equations not adequate

- Na atoms have assumed Maxwellian velocity distribution
