title: Point diffraction interferometry
authors: Daodang Wang, Rongguang Liang
year: 2017

notes:
- uses point diffraction limited spherical wavefront as an ideal measurement, can get this from the pinhole

- can be used to test error of the wavefront, see how far from spherical it is

- the wave is focussed on a pinhole, but as small hole get diffraction, then the plate is semi-transparent, thus can then see the spherical wave at peak of diffraction pattern

- then the two waves will interfere with each other, then be detected by a PZT scanner
