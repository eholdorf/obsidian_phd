# Notes:
- laser guide stars used to overcome atmosphere in AO
- currently cannot correct for tip-tilt (need NGS)
- look into using LGS to correct for tip-tilt
- want to study the horizontal distribution
- use these distributions to measure tip-tilt as they move across the sky
- to measure this, use event based sensors ?
	- don't detect background  - see varaitions in intensity
