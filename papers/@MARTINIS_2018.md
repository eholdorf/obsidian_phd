notes:
- Boston university has a network of all-sky imagers (ASIs) to look at the Earth’s upper atmosphere

- this paper summarises instrument design and data taking protocalls

- ASI is a camera which takes a picture of the whole sky using a fish-eye lens

- have 5 paired sites (pair is two locations which are at the ends of geomagntic field lines)

- airglow comes from photons emitted from atmospheric processes w chemistry

- most commonly is the dissociative recombination of ions and electrons

- these happen at all times airglow = nightglow + dayglow

- dayglow difficult due to the sun, but can be done w special techniques

- lots of variations from e.g. : plasma dynamcis, instabilities, waves, tides (see as modulation patterns in the brightness (waves and tides mainly in the MLT)

- two ways to see airglow structures: rapidly scanning photometers and camera w fish-eye lens

- have filter of 1.5nm, with 180 degree coverage

- need to consider the angle will change the wavelength - need less than 5 deg due to filter effects

- want all paths to be treated the same, so have  a lens before the image plane of the fish-eye lens 

- used 1024x1024 CCD with 0.013mm pixels, QE ~90%, RON of 3 electrons

- use a series of lenses as the fish-eye lens is much larger than the CCD

- before ASIs, used photometers and spectrometers

- w fish-eye lens, have problem of warping

- use height and pixel location to determine a longitude and latitude for each pixel

- for each site they have particular requirements: dark skies, favorable horizon, temp and humidity control

- take 2 min images every 10 mins (thus a 12 min cycle)

- w sites in both hemispheres are now comparing results to see if correlations
