authors: T. Bag, M. V. Sunil Krishna, Vir Singh
year: 2015
---
notes:
- sodium layer exists from the ablation of meteors in teh mesopause region

- the layer varies seasonally

- give examples of reactions that occur within the sodium layer

- sodium airglow ranges from 30-200 R (Rayleigh, photons/m$^2$/s/str)

- note there are 4$\pi$ steradians in a sphere
