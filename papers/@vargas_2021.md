title: Mesospheric gravity wave activity estimated via airglow imagery, multistatic meteor radar, and SABER data taken during the SIMONe–2018 campaign
authors: Fabio Vargas
year: 2021

notes:
- use all sky airglow imager

- 30mm fish eye lens, use 180 degrees of the sky

- Andor's iKon-M 934 camera is a 1024 × 1024 array and 13 µm pixel pitch with a 13.3 × 13.3 mm active image area. High sensitivity is achieved through a combination of > 90 % QE (quantum efficiency; back-illuminated sensor), low noise readout electronics, and deep TE (thermoelectric) cooling down to −60∘C

- The ASI system uses six interference filters enabling the observation of four mesosphere airglow emissions with a background filter for the hydroxyl emission

- take images every 10 mins
