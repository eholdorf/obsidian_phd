# Notes:
- note that think that there might be kelvin-helmholtz instabilities in the sodium layer
- that these instabilities come from sporadic sodium layers 
- but might suggest horizontal structure
- "In addition, the limitation of the available data set does not allow us to study the influence of small-scale horizontal/vertical variability - due largely to acoustic gravity waves - for this case."
- mention ^^ in the paper - thus suggesting that these features might exist??
