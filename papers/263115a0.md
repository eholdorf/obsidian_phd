# Notes:
- suggest that vertical distribution changes come from horizontal structures
- have no direct evidence for horizontal structure variation
- at mesopheric heights suggested by observations of hydroxyl emissions in airglow
- this research suggest that variations in the intensities from atmospheric gravity waves
- Na layer might also be effected by this
- using a laser, looked at the vertical distribution at lots of different places
- from there research Na layer changes density on periods of ~ 20 min, but fairly stable over ~ 1hr periods
