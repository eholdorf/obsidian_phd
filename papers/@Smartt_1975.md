title: Theory and application of point-diffraction interferometers
authors: R. N. Smartt, W. H. Steel
year: 1975

notes:
- point diffraction interferometer (PDI) is an interferometer that measures variation in the phase across a wavefront

- usually use a plane or spherical wave to interfere with the wave of interest to see the phase (interference shows the variations in the phase, and how this changes across the wavefront)

- this is then diffracted by a film in a pinhole to separate the reference waveÂ 

- so in summary, incident wave comes in, diffracted through a pinhole with absorbing film, this extracts the reference wave, and left with the transmitted wave which can be used to see how the phase is similar/ different to the reference to see the phase across the wave

- one disadvantage, is that the pinhole in reality has to have some physical size
