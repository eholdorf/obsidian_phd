notes:
- compared SH-WFS to Smartt PDI image quality of the wavefront abberations

- looked at the RMS of the Zernike polynomial co-efficients

- Zernike polynomials can be used to describe optical aberations

- wavefront flatness can be described by the RMS of the Zernike polynomial co-efficients

- SH-WFS: have an array of micro-lenslets and a CCD, each part of the wavefront should be put in a particular location on the CCD, but if not flat then will appear somewhere different, then these displacements describe the local slope or tilt of the WF

- PDI: have a semi-transparent plate with a pinhole in it, where a spherical wave is produced from the pinhole, and then the original wave can pass through the semi-transparent plate, then will see well defined fringes when these waves interact which can be used to derive the wave abberations

- from each set-up extracted the Zernike polynomial co-effs and used these to generate the RMS

- found that both techniques gave similar results

- have images of the WF for both systems, plus the true through time

- conclude that the PDI is simpler, but the SH-WFS is probably overall better, but cannot detect abberations smaller than the lenslets
