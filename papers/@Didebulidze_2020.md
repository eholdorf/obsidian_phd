title: Formation of multilayered sporadic e under an influence of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs)
authors: Goderdzi G. Didebulidze, Giorgi Dalakishvili, Maya Todua
year: 2020

notes:
- numerically and theoretically link formation of sporadic E layers to gravity waves

- seem to get sporadic E layer when the vertical wavelength of the gravity wave is smaller than the height of the region
