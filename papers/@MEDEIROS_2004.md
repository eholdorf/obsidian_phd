notes:
- all sky imager for airglow for OH, O$_2$ and OI in conjunction with utah state university

- most data from waves which last less than 1hr

- seems that waves seem to propagate in the direction of the warmer climate?

- saw 0.7 gravity wave events per hour

- waves have an average speed of ~26 m/s
