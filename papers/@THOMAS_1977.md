title: Lidar observations of a horizontal variation in the atmospheric sodium layer
authors: L. Thomas, A.J. Gibson, S.K. Bhattacharyya
year: 1977

notes:
- used a steerable lidar to look in 3 directions in Winkfield (England)

- airglow studies indicate that there are horizontal variations in MLT molecules

- looking at locations 80km apart ( have 3 points of a triangle, none in centre) (30 degrees)

- found that there was a difference in the column density at the 3 locations, thus there must be horizontal variations

- measured these variations over 2 nights, so not just a timing thing

- consistent with airglow gravity wave images
