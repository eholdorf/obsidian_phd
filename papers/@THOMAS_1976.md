authors: L. THOMAS, A. J. GIBSON, S. K. BHATTACHARYYA
year: 1976

notes:
- looked at the height distribution at several locations (zenith and 10 deg East (15km at layer))

- saw wave pass through the layer as height was moving differently at the different locations

- can't tell the difference between a wave and horizontal variation

- found that different locations have different vertical profiles, but that they profiles don't typically change much with time (at least in their 1hr integration)
