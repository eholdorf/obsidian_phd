title: All-sky imager observations of the latitudinal extent and zonal motion of magnetically conjugate 630.0 nm airglow depletions
authors: Carlos Martinis, Dustin Hickey, Joei Wroten, Jeffrey Baumgardner, Rebecca Macinnis, Caity Sullivan, Santiago Padilla
year: 2020

notes:
- airglow imagers see horizontal variations

- commonly used to look at how gravity waves propagate and how they impact molecules in the MLT (mesosphere and lower thermosphere)

- used all sky imager, sample an area of ~10^6 km^2

- Boston university has a network of ASIs (All-Sky Imagers)
