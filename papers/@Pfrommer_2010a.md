notes:
- the MLT is a very dynamic part of the atmosphere

- have some interesting plots of time and sodium density

- can see in this data, there are onset of KH instabilitiesÂ 

- this plot shows that the sodium density can vary over scales of seconds

- need NGS to get tip/tilt and focussing expecially w the larger telescopes as the LGS elongation will get bigger for larger telescoeps

- using wind assumption of 15m/s in the sodium layer

- SSLs show denstiy variations on the order of seconds
