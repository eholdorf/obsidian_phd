# Notes:
- two models (linear and non-linear) sodium layer changes from gravity waves
- find that at different altitudes the horizontal distribution would change from gravity waves
- only looked in resoltuions of km, but also assumed that the original gravity wave had a period of 100 km
- ![[sodium_layer_grav_waves.png]]
- ^^ is the distributions that they found for different gravity waves
- they determined that if you initially assume a uniform horizontal distrivution, then gravity waves would add horizontal variations
- show that the variations are 'frozen in time', but that winds could distort them 
- did these simulations at midnight and at midday and came to the same conclusions, thus these are relatively time independent conclusions
