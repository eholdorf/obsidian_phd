# Notes:
- allows ground based telescopes to reach diffraction limited images (superior spatial resolution)
- as ground based telescopes are larger, get better resolution than space based telescopes/ satellites

- ## How AO Works:
	- images originally blurred from the light passing through the atmosphere
		- similar to looking across a campfire (air of different temperatures)
	- different air temps and densities mean diff refractive indexes give spatial and temporal variations to path length of the light
	- variations mainly from troposphere (from Earth's surface to ~15km)
	- three parameters determine how well AO performs on 8-10m telescopes
		- Fried parameter ($r_0$): scale corrections are done on, $r_0$ propto $\lambda^{\frac{6}{5}}$
		- isoplanatic angle ($\theta_0$) - max angular radius get reasonably good correction
		- coherence time ($\tau_0$) - time frame that corrections are valid for
	- use WFS to measure wavefront, then send this information to a deformable mirror which corrects the incoming wavefront
	- using one NGS is single-conjugate AO (simplest)
		- this method have low $\theta_0$
	- not enough NGS that are bright enough, so make own a.k.a LGS
	- easier to get good corrections at longer wavelengths  (corrections $\propto \lambda^{\frac{-18}{5}}$)
	- ## Key Components:
		- wavefront sensing
			- give signal of shape of wavefront
			- usually visible wavelengths as CCDs most sensitive
			- three types of sensors : pyramid, Shack-Hartmann and Curvature (has diagram of how the three work)
				- Shack-Hartmann: use lenslet array to get positions of local wavefront, then use these spots to get gradient 
				- Pyramid: when light hits either side of pyramid tip, only appear in one of the pupils, use intensity distributions in each pupil to measure the ray's slope. repeat over several modulations finds wavefront slope
				- Curvature: measure intensity distributions of two different planes
			- all sensors degrade for low spatial frequencies (curvature WFS worst, but best for high spatial frequencies)
			- overall the pyramid is the best as high sensitivity and flexibility
		- wavefront reconstruction:
			- need to determine the voltages to be sent to the DM from the slopes from the WFS
			- becomes computationally complex (O(n$^2$)) and needs to be done for each time step (~1ms)
			- ways to improve complexity : Fast Fourier Transform (O(n log n)), fractal iterative (O(n)) but multiple steps needed, cumulative reconstructor (O(n)) 
			- further improve by using residual from previous wavefront to guess the current one (but adds computational complexity)
		- Deformable Mirror (DM)
			- correct optical path difference
			- array of acuators ona thin metal optical surface that deforms under acuator expansion
			- important features: stroke, response time, spacing and acuator number
				- spacing and response time determined by $r_0$ and $\tau_0$
				- stroke increases with aperature diameter ($d^{5/6}$)
				- most DMs now have thousands of actuators, but next gen of ELTs will require tens of thousnads as the spaing between the actuators determines how small of structures that can be corrected
			- usually use deformable secondary mirrors (so don't need to add more optics)
		- Estimating Performance
			- the performance depends on the particular science case
			- most commonly look at the residual wavefront variance or the Strehl ratio (two measurements are linked)
			- main errors are: fitting error, reconstruction error, temporal bandwidth error
			- strehl and PSSN error metrics are 1 for perfect AO and decrease as the correction gets worse
		- LGS
			- need bright stars to do accurate correction
			- need to be within $\theta_0$ of the target, so need them to be densely populated throughout the sky, which they aren't
			- approx 10% of the sky can be observed with just NGS
			- thus, use lasers to make artificial stars
				- rayleigh jean scattering
				- Na laser with Na layer
			- most AO systems use Na laser and Na layer (~90km up)
			- problems
				- don't sample full aperature at height of turbulent layers as finite distance between telescope and Na layer
				- cannot measure tip-tilt as path same up and back
			- so still need at least one NGS, but doesn't need to be as bright, so have access to more of the sky
	- AO has been helpful in a wide range of astrophysics fields, including asteroids, galaxy populations and exoplanets
	- ## PSF:
		- recovering the PSF remains an unsolved problem
		- astronomers want to be able to get this information from the wavefront, but still a challenge
		- role of PSF : deconvolution, model convolution. point source photometry and astronometry and speckle suppression
