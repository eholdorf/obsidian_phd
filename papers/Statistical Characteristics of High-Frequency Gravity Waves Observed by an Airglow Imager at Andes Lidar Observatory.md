# Notes: 
- Airglow imagers can be used to characterise gravity waves. Parameters which can be derived include horizontal wavelength (20 km to 30 km), vertical wavelength (15 km to 25 km), intrinsic speed (50 ms$^{-1}$ to 100 ms$^{-1}$) and intrinsic wave period (5 min to 10 min). 
- Seem to show that there are more waves in the Winter and move towards the equator, and less frequent in Summer but more pole-ward.
- Airglow imaging is commonly referred to as nightglow, and if imaging the emission of photons within the Earth's atmosphere. 
- These images are taken by taking advantage of chemiluminescence (the emission of light during a chemical reaction which doesn't produce significant quantities of heat) processes from species within the atmosphere. 
- Typically use emissions from the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (80 km to 100 km). For a typical observation, see a thin layer centred at a particular height. 
- To get information about gravity waves, look at intensity fluctuations.
- Typical airglow imager has a CCD and fish-eye lens (so can see a broad area of sky, but typically have resolutions better than 1 km per pixel). Then use several narrow-band filters to distinguish light from different wavelengths.
