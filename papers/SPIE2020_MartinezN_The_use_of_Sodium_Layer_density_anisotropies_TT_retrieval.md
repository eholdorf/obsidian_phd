# Notes:
- want to study horizontal distribution - could use plenoptic camera
	- plenoptic camera - get intensity and direction of light rays
- using AO for tip-tilt will allow 100% sky coverage
- sodium layer density varies on hourly, daily and yearly timescales
- minimum in summer and maximum in winter
- illuminate Na layer with uniform laser beam (make extended object)
